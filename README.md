## Overview

### The challenge

Flip Animation: It was tricky to get the flip animation to look smooth and ensure the components appeared and disappeared at the right time. I solved this by using setTimeout() to control the timing of when each component is hidden and shown.

Responsive Design: Ensuring that the design looks good on all screen sizes required careful tweaking of CSS media queries.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5: Markup language for the structure of the page.
- CSS3: For layout, animations, and responsiveness.
- JavaScript (ES6): To handle dynamic interactions and animations.
- Google Fonts: The project uses the Overpass font for a modern and clean look.
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

3D Transforms in CSS: This project helped me better understand how to use rotateY for 3D effects.
CSS Transitions and Animations: I deepened my knowledge of how to apply transitions to multiple properties like transform and opacity.
Event Handling in JavaScript: This project helped improve my skills in managing user interactions with JavaScript.
Here are some key features and code snippets that power the project:
The CSS for the flip animation:

```css
.rating-state, .thanku-state {
  transition: transform 0.6s ease-in-out, opacity 0.6s ease-in-out;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  backface-visibility: hidden;
}

.flip-out {
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
  opacity: 0;
}

.flip-in {
  transform: rotateY(0deg);
  opacity: 1;
}
```
This code adds a flip effect when transitioning between the rating and the "Thank You" screen:
```js
document.querySelector("button").addEventListener('click', function(){
  rating_state.classList.add('flip-out');
  setTimeout(() => {
    rating_state.classList.add('inactive_state');
    rating_state.classList.remove('flip-out');
    thanku_state.classList.remove('inactive_state');
    thanku_state.classList.add('flip-in');
  }, 600);
});
```
The following code snippet dynamically highlights the hovered rating and the previous ratings:
```js
const rating_number = document.querySelectorAll(".rating_container span");

rating_number.forEach(function (rate) {
  rate.addEventListener("mouseenter", function () {
    rate.classList.add('rating_hover');
    if (rate.previousElementSibling) {
      rate.previousElementSibling.classList.add('previous_ratin_btn');
    }
  });

  rate.addEventListener("mouseleave", function () {
    rate.classList.remove('rating_hover');
    if (rate.previousElementSibling) {
      rate.previousElementSibling.classList.remove('previous_ratin_btn');
    }
  });
});

```

### Continued development

Accessibility: I plan to add more accessibility features, such as keyboard navigation, to improve usability for all users.

Additional Animations: Iâ€™m considering adding further animations or visual effects to enhance the user experience even more.
